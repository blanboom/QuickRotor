Mini64 is a STM32 development board for OpenSTM32 project (https://github.com/gbulmer/openstm32).

for details).

Features:
- Small (52x38.4mm) breadboard compatible design.
- Support for STM32F103/F2xx/F4xx in 64-pin packages.
- 3 separate voltage regulators - two small current LDOs for MCU (separate for analog/digital parts) and one 
  800ma LDO for sourcing external load.
- LiPol battery charger
- RTC crystal on board
- CR2032 battery holder for RTC on board
- Automatic power source selection
- One user button connected as in Maple board
- Two user LEDs, one connected as in Maple board and one connected as in Maple Mini board

The design files were created in Eagle 5.11. Pictures of board can be found at 
https://picasaweb.google.com/101499174242780444159/Mini64.

At present design is single sided and suitable for DIY PCB production, although the requirements
to the production process is quite high - board uses 0.15/0.15mm traces/spaces and designed with
presence of solder mask in mind. The design is optimized for dry film negative photoresist process. 
Design files as-is are ready to use for ordering boards at some PCB production service.
Although they can be used for DIY production too, it might be useful to do following changes 
in the design files before creating photomask:

- Increase width of the dimension rectangle to 0.2mm and include it into top layer and 
  solder mask photomasks.
- Change width of default net class tracks to 0.17mm.
- Change width of vcc net class tracks except GND polygon to 0.32mm. 
- Change width of GND polygon wire to 0.1mm

NOTE: After these changes board will not pass DRC! If you plan make further modifications in the 
PCB changed as described above, change DRC rules accordingly.

Comments and suggestions are welcome.
